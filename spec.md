## Buttons
•	New User: This button allows administrators to create a new user. It is located in the upper left corner of the screen and is colored blue.

•	Save User: This button saves any changes made to user information. It is located in the upper right corner of the screen and is colored pale blue.

## Table
•	ID: This column displays a unique identifier for each user.

•	User Name: This column displays the user's username.

## Form

## **User Interaction**

## Viewing Users
When the user management screen is first displayed, the table on the left side of the screen will display all existing users. The user's ID, username, email address, and whether their account is enabled or disabled will be displayed.
If the Hide Disabled User checkbox is checked, any disabled users will be hidden from the table.

## Adding Users

To add a new user, the administrator should click the New User button in the upper left corner of the screen. This will display a form on the right side of the screen. The administrator should then fill in the fields for the new user's information, including a unique username, display name, phone number, email address, role, and whether the account is enabled or disabled.
Once all fields have been filled in, the administrator can click the Save User button in the upper right corner of the screen to save the new user information.

## Editing Users
To edit an existing user's information, the administrator should click on the user's row in the table on the left side of the screen. This will display the user's information in the form on the right side of the screen. The administrator can then edit any of the fields in the form.
Once the changes have been made, the administrator should click the Save User button in the upper right corner of the screen to save the updated user information.
## Deleting Users
To delete an existing user, the administrator should click on the user's row in the table on the left side of the screen. This will highlight the row in red. The administrator can then click the Delete button that appears to delete the user.
